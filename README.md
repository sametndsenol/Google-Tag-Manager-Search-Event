# GA4 Search Advanced Tracking â€“ GTM Setup

Track which products are shown in the search results of your website and send each as a GA4 event via GTM.

## ðŸ”§ What it does

For each visible product (up to 5), the script pushes a `search_advanced` event to `dataLayer` with the following structure:

```js
{
  event: 'search_advanced',
  action: 'search term from URL',
  label: 'product name',
  category: 'search result',
  value: 1
}
```
